# Why the name chill-chicken-roll?
Umm, to be exact. I was just craving some chilli chicken roll from our college and was searching for a name for the project simulataneously.<br/>
So, the idea stuck me. When do I meet most random people or my close ones and have a chat with them?<br/>
**While having chilli-chicken-roll.**<br/>
And hence, the name.<br/> 
Changed it to chill-chicken-roll as you are supposed to chill and then roll.<br/>
I know, sounds dumb. But, good name tho.<br/>
